# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_ML_and_Dash
This project is a Diabetes Prediction System that uses Machine Learning (ML) and a web-based interface built with Dash. It analyzes user health data, such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age, to predict whether a person has diabetes. The ML model is trained using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and applies Logistic Regression for predictions. If diabetes is detected, it also classifies it into Type 1, Type 2, or Gestational Diabetes and provides diet and yoga recommendations based on the prediction. The Dash web app allows users to enter their details through a simple and interactive interface, making it easy to get real-time predictions and health advice. 
Features :
✔ Machine Learning-based diabetes prediction
