# Diabetes_Prediction_Using_ML_and_Dash
This project is a Diabetes Prediction System that uses Machine Learning (ML) and Dash to provide a web-based interface for predicting diabetes. It analyzes user health data, such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, insulin, and age, to determine the likelihood of diabetes. The machine learning model is built using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and applies Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy. The model is evaluated using confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC curve.

The project also offers health recommendations. If diabetes is detected, it classifies the type as Type 1, Type 2, or Gestational Diabetes and provides diet and yoga suggestions to help users manage their condition.

The Dash web application provides an interactive platform where users can enter their health details and get real-time predictions. The UI is simple, user-friendly, and built with Dash Bootstrap Components. The app displays prediction results along with personalized recommendations, helping users make informed health decisions.

This project is useful for early risk assessment of diabetes and promotes healthy lifestyle choices through personalized recommendations.
